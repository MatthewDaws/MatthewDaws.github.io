<h1>Python stuff</h1>

**Pre-compiled modules**

Getting non-pure-Python addons to work on Windows seems to be a pain (or at least, I haven't dedicted the time to getting mingw to work...)  Fortunately, the internet comes to the rescue:

   - Windows binaries for Python Extensions: [By Christoph Gohlke](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/)
   - Note: I'm currently using [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/)

**Numpy**

   - Homepage: [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
   - NumPy [Manual](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/index.html)

**matplotlib**

   - Homepage of [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/index.html)
   - Colours: [API docs](http://matplotlib.org/api/colors_api.html)

**iPython**

   - iPython is a wonderful thing; combined with browser based notebooks, it's even better: [Homepage](http://ipython.org/)
   - View iPython notebooks in static mode in a webrowser: [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/faq)
