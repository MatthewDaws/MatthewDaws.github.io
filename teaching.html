    <h1 class="my-5" id="teaching">Teaching</h1>

    <p>I lecture on a wide variety of undergraduate level courses, along with working with students on projects at undergraduate
    and masters level.</p>

    <p>Students can find all resources on Blackboard.  Some older resources can be found below.</p>

    <h3>Year 2018/19</h3>

    <p>I lecture on three courses, spanning the three undergraduate years: <strong>Introduction to Real Analysis</strong>,
        <strong>Cryptology</strong>, and <strong>Complex Analysis</strong>.
        I have re-written the Cryptology course, and changed the assessment to be more continuous, thus allowing more student feedback.
        I am supervising a group Mathematical Modelling project on <strong>Queueing Theory</strong>, and a masters project on
        <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, a blend
        between theory and some practical work with the Python ML stack.
    </p>

    <h3>Year 2017/18</h3>

    <p>I joined uclan midway through the teaching year, but immediately picked up two lecture courses, <strong>Introduction to Real Analysis</strong>
        and <strong>Cryptology</strong>, as well as covering for a colleague on the course <strong>Further Real Analysis</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Previously</h3>

    <p>In my previous lecturing position, I lectured on a wide range of courses including 1st year Analysis (a major re-write
        of the course), 2nd year Linear Algebra, 3rd year Metric spaces (to a joint-honours cohort), a masters course on Measure
        Theory, and a first year "Calculus" course.  I tutored a variety of student projects, from short projects through to
        full year masters level projects.  I also ran a reading course, see below.
    </p>


    <h1 class="my-5" id="rc">Introduction to Banach Spaces and Algebras</h1>

    <p>In 2012 I lead a reading course on the book
    &quot;Introduction to Banach Spaces and Algebras&quot; by Graham Allan
    (an old lecturer of mine).  See <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Introduction-Banach-Algebras-Graduate-Mathematics/dp/0199206546">Amazon link</a>
    or <a href="http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199206544.do">OUP link</a> to
    buy the book.</p>
    
    <p>I had a slightly troubled time with this book.  Some positives:</p>
    <ul><li>The book is self-contained, and would be accessible to anyone with a basic course
    in Banach spaces, but without exposure to the Baire Category family of results, nor to
    any measure theory.</li>
    <li>The book takes you all the way to understanding the basics of von Neumann algebras, with
    a careful treatment of various functional calculus theorems.</li>
    <li>It's hard to think of any modern book which is similar.</li></ul>
    <p>However, there are also some negatives:</p>
    <ul><li>At times, this is not an &quot;introduction&quot;-- consider the treatment of
    the weak and weak* topologies; or see below for various clarifications which I had
    to write.</li>
    <li>The decision not to sure measure theory didn't, sadly, make sense from the point of
    view of the programme at Leeds, at least when I ran the course.  Similarly, not introducing nets makes for what feels
    like a very convoluted treatment of von Neumann algebras.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Original advert: the original plan.  We ended up covering less material than this.
    <a href="files/bsa/blurb.tex">LaTeX Source</a> and <a href="files/bsa/blurb.pdf">PDF</a>.</li>
    <li>Summary: this gives a guided reading of the book which I followed.
    <a href="files/bsa/summary.tex">LaTeX Source</a> and <a href="files/bsa/summary.pdf">PDF</a>.</li>
    <li>Corrections and clarifications: There are a number of places in the book where it's
    written: "it's easy to see..." or similar.  This is of course a dangerous thing to do, and
    I think in a number of places very misleading.  This document gives some more details.
    The same applies to some exercises: some of these are much (much) harder than the author(s)
    must have thought.

    <h1 id="pop" class="my-5">Popular talks etc.</h1>

    <p>I helped <a href="http://richardelwes.co.uk/2009/04/10/talking-knot-sense/">Richard Elwes</a> give a
    popular talk, to sixth-form students, on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(mathematical)">knot theory</a>.
    This was part of the Leeds Festival of Science.  Special thanks to Ruth Holland,
    Hazel Kendrick and David Pauksztello.  We repeated the effort as a
    &quot;Reach for Excellence session&quot;.</p>
    
    <p>The following are some handouts (with LaTeX source) which I produced.
    The margins of the PDF files are off, probably because I used pstricks, and
    hence ps2pdf, instead of pdflatex.</p>
    <ul><li>Some knots: <a href="files/outreach/knot_handout1.pdf">PDF file</a> and
    <a href="files/outreach/knot_handout1.tex">LaTeX source</a>.</li>
    <li>The writhe: <a href="files/outreach/knot_handout2.pdf">PDF file</a> and
    <a href="files/outreach/knot_handout2.tex">LaTeX source</a>.</li>
    <li>The bracket polynomial: <a href="files/outreach/knot_handout3.pdf">PDF file</a> and
    <a href="files/outreach/knot_handout3.tex">LaTeX source</a>.</li>
    <li>The Jones polynomial: <a href="files/outreach/knot_handout4.pdf">PDF file</a> and
    <a href="files/outreach/knot_handout4.tex">LaTeX source</a>.  Experts will notice that
    we massaged the definition a little!</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Recently, again with Richard Elwes, I gave a session as part of the
    <a href="http://www.leeds.ac.uk/festivalofscience/">Leeds festival of science</a> on
    the subject of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick%27s_theorem">Pick's Theorem</a>.
    It is always tricky leading A-Level students through a pure mathematics proof, but it's also
    very pleasing to see some students (often not those you expect!) suddenly "get" the point, and
    start to really understand something new.</p>
    <ul><li><a href="files/outreach/pick_handout.pdf">Handout (PDF)</a> which should be used with the
    excellent JAVA applet at: <a href="http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Geometry/Geoboard.shtml">
    Cut the knot Geoboard</a></li>
    <li><a href="files/outreach/pick_spotted_paper.pdf">More spotted paper (PDF)</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="files/outreach/pick_proof.pdf">Proof of the theorem</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>I run a &quot;Quiz night&quot; as part of the annual 6th Form Conference
    held at the university.  Thanks for Alan Slomson, on whose idea this was based.
    Contact me if you would like further information:
    I won't post the quiz, to discourage cheating!</p>
