<h3>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</h3>

<p>By Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides

<p>The &quot;classic&quot; book on software design patterns, targetting mainly C++.
I really liked this book: it's written in the sort of academic style that I'm used
to, and it formalised and explained many ideas I've been seeing in other books, and
seeing when reading other people's code.</p>

<p>I guess I worry about the age of the book (20 years seems a long time in software 
development).  Next up is to read Head First Design Patterns.</p>

<h3>Head First Design Patterns</h3>

<p>By Eric Freeman et al  <a href="http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2680052~S5">[Leeds]</a>
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Freeman/dp/0596007124">[Amazon]</a></p>

<p>A classic: a "follow-up" to the "Gang of Four" design patterns book.  It's aimed at
Java programmers (but easy to read if you don't know Java but are willing to guess at
what various things mean) but, mainly, it's trying out a very different "style" of book.
Sort of hard to describe, but you'll know what I mean if you've seen any of this series.</p>

<p>It's very easy to read, and reinforced what I'd gotten out of the Gang of Four
book.  The examples are also more "business driven" and hence seem more up-to-date
than the C++ examples in Design Patterns. The end chapter on MVC was useful; but
the "summary" of the missing patterns was almost too short to be useful (when you
can just look them up on Wikipedia anyway...)</p>

<p>That all said, I'm not sure this is something I'd want as a reference.  The
Gang of Four book is easier to dip back into, and C++ is in some ways the harder
language to implement things in, so if you understand the idea, putting it to use
in Java/C# should be easier.</p>

<h3>Introduction to the design &amp; analysis of algorithms</h3>

<p>By Anany Levitin.  <a href="http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b3224265">[Leeds]</a>
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Introduction-Analysis-Algorithms-International-Version/dp/027376411X">[Amazon]</a></p>

<p>Nice, good read.  Covers analysis of algorithm efficiency, which to a mathematician is all
routine stuff.  Focuses on searching and sorting problems, and graph problems.  Has sections
on Brute Force methods, Decrease-and-Conquer, Divide-and-Conquer, Transform-and-Conquer,
Space/Time trade offs, Dynamic programming, Greedy techniques, Iterative Improvements, Approximate
Solutions to NP problems.  It's a good introduction, and many of the exercises are nice.  But
not enough detail to be used as a reference.  Expensive.</p>


<h3>Introduction to automata theory, languages, and computation</h3>

<p>By John E. Hopcroft, Rajeev Motwani, Jeffrey D. Ullman.
<a href="http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2855295">[Leeds]</a>
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Introduction-Automata-Theory-Languages-Computation/dp/8131720470">[Amazon]</a></p>

<p>A good, nicely mathematical, introduction to automatas, regular languages
(the theory behind regular expressions) and context-free languages.  The latter
part of the book then picks up Turing machines, and nicely explains P vs NP etc.
(I guess, naively, that non-deterministic things look quite motivated from the
point of view of automatas, where they add nothing to the recognised languages).</p>

<h3>How to think like a computer scientist: Learning with Python</h3>

<p>By Allen Downey, Jeffrey Elkner, Chris Meyers.
<a href="http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2431829">[Leeds]</a>
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Think-Like-Computer-Scientist/dp/0971677506">[Amazon]</a></p>

<p>Easy read, introducing both basic programming, and Python.  Could read in
an afternoon.  Nice that it introduced some basic ideas from computer science,
as well as basic programming.  But too basic for me, and not even suitable as
a reference.  Related to:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/">Think Python</a>

&pound;20 from O'Reilly.</li>
<li>"Python for Software Design: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist" by
Allan Downey, ISBN 978-0521725965.  At a rough read, this seems rather similar
to the older book, but without the data types chapters at the end.

<h3>The Quick Python Book 2nd edition</h3>

<p>By Vernon L. Ceder <a href="http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b3120251">[Leeds]</a>
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Quick-Python-Book-Naomi-Ceder/dp/193518220X">[Amazon]</a></p>

<p>A quick introduction to the basics of Python programming.  I found this to be a very
easy read after spending some time (re)learning C++ programming.  I would think this would
be hard work if you didn't know some programming already.  It's not really a book I'd want
to own though, as it doesn't need to be re-read, and it doesn't go far enough into the
language to be a reference.</p>


<h3>Learning Python</h3>

<p>By Mark Lutz <a href="http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2994141">[Leeds]</a>
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Learning-Python-Mark-Lutz/dp/1449355730">[Amazon]</a>
<a href="http://www.foyles.co.uk/witem/computing-it/learning-python,mark-lutz-9781449355739">[Foyles]</a></p>

<p>The fifth edition is more like a door stop than a book (1600 pages, which even for
a computer book is long!)  I'm afraid I have to agree with many of the Amazon reviewers:
this book is too verbose, and many of the words could have been cut without losing
information.  There is a lot of repetition.  I found it unhelpful that the same
(simple) example would be repeated endlessly with minor variations as new ideas
were introduced.  Longer, more complicated worked examples would have helped in
places.</p>

<p>However, I did find the book to be extremely clear.  That it was verbose also meant
it was an easy read-- something I could literally read in bed.  I think it was
worth reading, but I'm not sure I'll be going back to it much.  There are various
"cookbook" books which seem more useful-- once you know the basics, it makes
more sense (to me) to look at real-world examples.  For example: how would I actually
use a metaclass in a complex problem?</p>

<p>Finally, a slight pet peeve: there's almost no mention of the standard library!
Yes, the library does evolve quite quickly, and it's large.  But it would be great
to have a quick guide to the modules, and their main uses.  The online help can do
the rest, but even knowing where to start looking can be useful.</p>


<h3>Python Pocket Reference</h3>

<p>By Mark Lutz
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Python-Pocket-Reference-OReilly/dp/1449357016">[Amazon]</a>
<a href="">[Foyles]</a></p>

<p>Genuinely pocket sized, this 7 by 4 inch, 250 page book does what it says.  It's a great little
reference, for both Python 2.7 and 3.4, to the core language and main standard library modules.
I've found it to be a really useful format to dip into as I've learnt about Python-- the physical
book format means you can flick between pages easily, look things up the index in no time etc.
Python of course comes with a great help package, and for general standard library reference, I do
find myself just using the help file, or looking online.  But, for example, for syntax issues, the
book is much easier to flick though, and a much faster reference.</p>

<p>If I had to quibble, then I'd say that the module coverage at the end is a little odd: I
probably don't need a quick reference to the sys module, nor to writing GUIs or interfacing with
databases.  I wouldn't mind having more on, say, the collections module, or similar.  Maybe that's
my bias as a user.</p>

<p>And, for the price, you can't go wrong!</p>


<h3>Python For Data Analysis</h3>

<p>By Wes McKinney
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1449319793">[Amazon]</a>
<a href="http://www.foyles.co.uk/witem/computing-it/python-for-data-analysis,wes-mckinney-9781449319793">[Foyles]</a></p>

<p>pandas is a data analysis library for Python, and this book, written by the original author of pandas, is an excellent guide to its usage.  The book starts with some "interactive" (you are invited to download data from internet sources yourself, and use the code provided to analyse it) demos of the main features.  Then chapters cover the main features: the "dataframe" model, loading and saving data, how to "wrangle" data (reshape, clean, merge), grouping operations and then some more specialist chapters on time series and financial data.</p>

<p>pandas is built upon the numpy optimised array system, and the book also contains an excellent introduction to numpy, along with a closing chapter on more advanced features.  Similarly, matplotlib is used for plotting, and a chapter introduces this package.  Also included is a chapter on the (also excellent) ipython interactive python system, and finally, an appendix which provides a brief, but useful, introduction to the basics of python itself.</p>

<p>Inevitably, as pandas is developed, the book won't cover the cutting edge.  However, I found it to be a great introduction, and very easy to read.  The code style, of mimicking an interactive python session, means you can read the book and see how the code would work, without having to actually have a computer in front of you (but that's obviously the best way to learn).</p>

<h3>More Effective C++</h3>

<p>By Scott Meyers <a href="http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b1535658~S5">[Leeds]</a>
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/More-Effective-Programs-Professional-Computing/dp/020163371X">[Amazon]</a>
[Foyles: Out of stock]</a></p>

<p>Rather old, but still, I found, a beautiful read (but which I mean, I could read
this in bed, and make sense of it, but I also never felt the pace was tedious, nor the
language verbose.)  It is presented as a series of
"items", each covering some aspect of C++.  Some of these are rather out of date:
talk of the STL being something strange, for example!  I think also some items would
these days be covered under the term "design patterns" (e.g. Proxy Classes).</p>

<p>I'm not quite sure about the re-readability.  It would be very nice to have a rather
short reference: perhaps a list of the titles and a paragraph or two summary.  A
quick search online didn't find such a thing.</p>

<p>Scott Meyers has an interesting website: <a href="http://www.aristeia.com/books.html">Scott Meyers: Books</a>
which contains details of a version of Effective C++ for C++11/14.</p>


<h3>Practical C++ Programming</h3>

<p>By Steve Oualline <a href="http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2255450~S5">[Leeds]</a>
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Practical-C-Programming-Steve-Oualline/dp/0596004192">[Amazon]</a></p>

<p>Not a book for me.  It's somewhat an introduction (although many online reviews suggest
that if you are a beginner, it's hard work) and barely touches on more advanced features.
However, I think the real issue is how old it is.  Today, templated just work.  We have
C++11.  Compilers and pretty good at optimising.  You have a good standard library.
The book dedicates just a short chapter to templates, and some of that is around
practical issues about getting the compiler to work.  There are also some
<a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596004194.do#PowerReview">scathing reviews</a> on the O'Reilly website.</p>

<p>In the book's defense, it does touch upon some software engineering issues, which is
nice to see.</p>

<h3>Getting Things Done</h3>

<p>By <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Allen_%28author%29">David Alen</a>.
<a href="http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2909966">[Leeds]</a>
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-free-Productivity/dp/0749922648">[Amazon]</a>
</p>

<p>Interesting read, if overly long.  I've put some of the ideas into
practise-- keep lists of things to do; but also key to the whole thing is this
idea of "What's the next action?".  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Wikipedia
entry</a> gives a good overview, and some of the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/review/R1HFU7HCNMCG1N/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0749922648&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=266239&store=books">reviews
on Amazon</a> similarly give good summaries.</p>
