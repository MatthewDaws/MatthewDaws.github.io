    <p>Posted on 6th May 2015</p>
    <hr>

    <p>Busy at 5pm Saturday when this ran (so all the eggs in the final basket of round 1C).  Under timed conditions, I did problem A very slowly, and B-small in the time, so would have qualified at around place 770.  B-large took a bit longer, and Problem C wasn't really looked at in the time limit.  Hard problems...</p>
<p>As ever, links to: <a href="https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/8224486/dashboard#s=a&amp;a=2">Official Contest Analysis</a> and my code on <a href="https://github.com/MatthewDaws/CodeJam/tree/master/2015_1b">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Problem A, Counter Culture:</strong> How fast can you get from <code>N</code> from 1 if you are allowed moves of: say one more than the last numbers; or reverse the decimal number.  E.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 21, 22, 23 is the quickest route to 23.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>My solution is the same as the official one, but my reasoning is different (and was, under pressure, motivated by some interactive experiments with a brute-force dynamic programming solution).  Notice that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The "reverse" move cannot increase the number of digits, so to get to a four digit number, say, you must go through 999, 1000, 1001 etc.</li>
<li>So the problem splits up into moving as quickly as possible to 10, 100, 1000 etc. and then finally to the target number</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's think about "invariant".  I've been reading the excellent book <a href="http://www.inference.eng.cam.ac.uk/mackay/itila/">"Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms"</a> by David MacKay and he uses the term "Lyapunov Function" for any function which decreases with each step of an algorithm: this can be used to prove convergence.  We'll use a similar idea here.</p>
<p>Suppose the target number is of even length and we've already got to 100...000 of the same length.  Think about <em>working backwards</em> from N.  So the moves become "decrease" or "reverse" (but now we are not allowed to reverse a number ending in 0).  Let <code>n1</code> be the lower half of the number, and <code>n2</code> be the upper half, but reversed, so for example, <code>N = 123456</code> gives <code>n1 = 456, n2=321</code>.  Then the "reverse" move swaps <code>n1</code> and <code>n2</code> while the "decrease" move will either decrease <code>n1</code>, or if <code>n1 = 0</code> then <code>n1</code> becomes <code>9...9</code> and something complicated happens to <code>n2</code> (the most significant digit is decreased, with "borrows" going down).  In particular, we see that <code>n1 + n2</code> is left unchanged by "reverse", decreases by 1 if <code>n1&gt;0</code>, or increases perhaps by a lot.  From this observation, it's now easy to see that the following algorithm is optimal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repeatedly decrease until <code>n1=1</code>.</li>
<li>Then "reverse" so now <code>n2=1</code> and <code>n1</code> is something else.</li>
<li>Repeatedly decrease until <code>n1=1</code>, and we've arrived at 10...01</li>
<li>Now decrease twice to 9...9 and then recurse.</li>
</ul>
<p>Optimal because it decreases <code>n1+n2</code> at all steps except the "reverse"; any other algorithm must increase <code>n1+n2</code> at some point.</p>
<p>When the target number is odd length, we argue in a similar way, with a new number <code>n3</code> being the middle digit, and the new invariant being <code>n1 + n2 + 10^k n3</code> where <code>10^k</code> is the correct power to put <code>n3</code> in the right place, e.g. if <code>N = 12345</code> then <code>n1=45, n2=21, n3=3, 10^k = 100</code>.  We now decrease until <code>n3=0, n1=1</code> and then reverse and then decrease again.</p>
<p><strong>Problem B, Noisy Neighbors:</strong>  Just a special case optimisation problem.  Brute force the small case, and my large case solution is no different to the official solution.</p>
<p><strong>Problem C, Hiking Deer:</strong> This was fun, and admits a nice analysis.  Herbert wants to avoid hikers, and at first it seems we have to consider the interaction of hikers; but this is not so.  Consider Herbert aiming to complete his walk in time <code>T</code>.  Then Hikers can do the following (perhaps the same hiker does all these at different times):</p>
<ul>
<li>Starts at time 0 from degree D (<em>read the question:</em> <code>1 &lt;= D &lt; 360</code>) and gets to degree 360 == 0 at time <code>&lt; T</code>.  Then Herbert can avoid the hiker.</li>
<li>As above, but gets to degree 360 at time <code>&gt;= T</code>.  Herbert must meet the hiker at least once.</li>
<li>Starts from degree 0 at time <code>&lt; T</code> and gets to degree 360 == 0 again next at time <code>&lt;= T</code>.  Herbet must meet the hiker at least once.</li>
<li>Starts from degree 0 at time <code>&lt; T</code> and gets to degree 360 == 0 again next at time <code>&gt; T</code>.  Herbert can avoid.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that Herbert can make the optimal number of encounters by choosing a constant velocity path.  So we may assume that Herbert indeed moves at constant speed, and just check which time T is best.  For the small cases this is easy, but the Large case needs a trick, e.g. a Heap based priority queue as in the offical solution, which even in Python is plenty fast enough.</p>
