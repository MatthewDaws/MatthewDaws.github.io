        <p>LED lights seem a no-brainer: instant on, good colour reproduction, extremely energy efficient (cool to the touch after minutes of use).  But they are expensive.  I wonder what the payback time is?</p>

        <p>More a note to a future self than aything else...  In C++ we have the notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Acquisition_Is_Initialization">Resource Acquisition Is Initialization</a> which I think I have internalised as the following:</p>
<blockquote class="card-body">
<p>Any "resource" (memory, file, handle etc.) should be "owned" by an object.  An object's constructor should allocate the resource, and the destructor should free the resource (with some appropriate choices then made for what copy/move constructors/assignments should do).  By use of C++11 <code>unique_ptr</code> and <code>shared_ptr</code> this model can be extended to pointers.</p>

        <h2 class="card-title">BF interpreter in C++</h2>
        <p>BF is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">amusingly named, impractical, Turing complete</a> programming language.  It is very like an actual Turing machine: you have an infinite (originally, one-sided, 30K long) array of (8-bit) values, with commands to increase/decrease (+/-) the cell, or move left/right (</>).  Input (,) and output (.) are handled.  Loops are given by [] and implement a "while cell is non-zero" loop.  So a trivial mapping to C is possible (see the Wikipedia article).</p>
<p>I thought it would be fun to give an object oriented implementation, for which I used C++ for a change.  My implementation decouples the parsing of the programme from running it.  The parse class reads the input in a single pass, using a stack for dealing with nested loops.  It translates the input into a list of commands, represented by an abstract base class with an <code>execute</code> method, overloaded for the various different commands.  This is the "command" pattern (closely related to the "strategy" pattern).</p>

        <h2 class="card-title">CodeJam 2015 Round 2</h2>
        <p>Round 2 came and went (and Round 3 and the "distributed" round).  As an effort to practice with C#, I solved these problems in C# (definitely slower than using Python, and actually, the end running time is not that much quicker, for these sort of algorithmic / numerical problems).</p>
<p>There's a definite step-up in difficulty here!  Maybe I kid myself I could have done problem A and some "small" problems quickly... that people did them all in 150 minutes is quite scary.  The <a href="">Official Contest Analysis</a> is rather brief (from G+, it seems the organisers were busy with the distributed round; or maybe, if we've come this far, shorter answers are all we need ;-&gt; )  I think my background in pure Maths shows here: I found problem D quite easy, as I found analysing the special cases off-line (pen and paper) to be not so hard.  Problems B and C (in "large" form) were hard, I thought.  (I missed the trick with problem B; and using an off-the-shelf Graph package is obviously the fast way to do Problem C.)</p>
<p>See the code on <a href="https://github.com/MatthewDaws/CodeJam/tree/master/2015_2">GitHub</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="card-title">Thoughts about C#</h2>
        <p>On the basis that knowing a modern OO language would be good, and on the basis that everyone and their granny knows JAVA, I thought I'd look at C#.  Getting going with C# was a bit tedious: I end up looking things up endlessly, and puzzling over things for a while before they "click" and seem obvious (which is always annoying, as then I'm left wondering why it wasn't obvious from the start).  You wait for muscle memory to build...  </p>
<p>Example: A small mistake lead to some musings on how sort algorithms are implemented: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30865510/why-does-failing-to-recognise-equality-mess-up-c-sharp-listt-sort">StackOverFlow Question</a> (the actual problem came from thinking about orderings in Python and C++ too much, where you specify a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_ordering#Strict_weak_orderings">strict weak ordering</a>, basically "less than", and then porting that to a <code>CompareTo</code> method and missing a corner-case.  This came up in a <a href="./20152.html">CodeJam problem</a>.)</p>

        <h2 class="card-title">Disjoint Paths; Implementation Issues</h2>
        <p>Mostly as an excuse to <a href="./ThoughtsCSharp.html">learn C#</a> I implemented the <a href="./Paths.html">path finding algorithms</a>.  Running some tests (random graphs, and then computing cuts from found disjoint paths, as to verify a "cut" is easy!) caught some implementation issues.  All obvious with hindsight.</p>
<h2>Notes on the implementation</h2>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/MatthewDaws/CS_Learning/blob/master/bits/Graphs_Paths.cs">file on GitHub</a>.  I wanted to use interfaces, and extension methods, as they are features of C# which differ from e.g. C++.  In hindsight, I think an abstract base case <code>Graph</code> would have been more sensible, with <code>DirectedGraph</code> and <code>UndirectedGraph</code> inheriting from this.</p>

        <p>A few notes on paths in graphs: finding the maximum number of edge/vertex disjoint paths, and an application to finding disconnections.</p>
<h2>Edge disjoint paths</h2>
<p>Consider a graph, for the moment undirected.  We wish to find the maximum number of edge disjoint paths from a fixed vertex \(s\) to a fixed vertex \(t\).  We can do this with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max-flow_min-cut_theorem">Max-Flow Min-Cut theorem</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford%E2%80%93Fulkerson_algorithm">Ford-Fulkerson algorithm</a>, at least in the directed case, but let's specialise this to our case.</p>
