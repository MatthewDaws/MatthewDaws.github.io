        <p>Finally, I can combine the <a href="2023-07-07-quantum-chromatic-numbers.html">last post</a> with <a href="2023-07-03-fixed-points.html">a post 3 ago</a>.  This argument is from a paper of Elphick and Wocjan, attributed there to Roberson.</p>
<p>Fix a graph \( G \) with adjacency matrix \( A \).</p>
<blockquote class="card-body">
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> Let \( \mathcal C \) be a pinching on \( \mathbb M_n\otimes\mathcal B(H) \) with \( \mathcal C(A\otimes 1_H)=0 \) and \( \mathcal C(D\otimes 1_H)=D\otimes 1_H \) for each diagonal matrix \( D \).  Then \( \mathcal C \) arises from a quantum colouring of \( G \), in the manner described before.</p>

        <h2 class="card-title">Quantum chromatic numbers</h2>
        <p>Continuing from the <a href="2023-07-04-spectral-bounds.html">last post</a> I want to now consider the <em>Quantum Chromatic Number</em> of a graph.  These ideas arose from Quantum Information Theory, which explore how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement">quantum entanglement</a> can be used in certain two-person "games", which are very similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_proof_system">Interactive proof systems</a>.  While the motivation can be a little hard to explain, the resulting mathematical formalism is straightforward.</p>
<blockquote class="card-body">
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A <em>quantum \( c \)-colouring</em> of \( G \) is a collection of orthogonal projections \( \{P_{v,k} : v\in V_G, k\in [c] \} \) on some Hilbert space \( H \) (usually assumed finite-dimensional) such that:</p>
<ol>
<li>\( \sum_{k=1}^c P_{v,k} = 1_H \) for each \( v \);</li>
<li>\( P_{v,k} P_{w,k} = 0 \) for each \( k \) and each edge \( v\sim w \) in \( G \).</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a more complicated (but motivated) definition in [Cameron et al.] (see references below) where the reduction to this definition is essentially shown Proposition 1 and the later observations.  It is also shown there that, when \( H \) is finite dimensional, we can always assume that each projection has the same rank (though this is sometimes not natural.)  The following is the same spectral bound which we discussed before, but now for the <em>quantum chromatic number</em> \( \chi_q(G) \), the least \( c \) for which \( G \) has a quantum \( c \)-colouring.</p>
<blockquote class="card-body">
<p><strong>Theorem: [Elphick-Wocjan]</strong> \( \chi_q(G) \geq 1+\frac{\lambda_1}{-\lambda_n} \).</p>

        <h2 class="card-title">Spectral bounds on the chromatic number</h2>
        <p>Recently <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Clive-Elphick-2">Clive Elphink</a> gave us a nice seminar where he discussed some of his "conjectures in spectral graph theory".  Clive has an interesting history: after a career in business, he is now semi-retired and returned to research mathematics.  By his own admission, he is more on the experimental side, and his talk said almost nothing about proofs.  Here is a old result in this area:</p>
<blockquote class="card-body">
<p><strong>Theorem [Hoffman]:</strong> We have that \( \chi(G) \geq 1 + \frac{\lambda_1}{-\lambda_n} \).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I explain the notation shortly, but in words, this result relates a vertex colouring of a graph to the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix.  To me, this seems hugely surprising, as why would the spectrum of \( A \) have anything to do with a vertex colouring?  I want to explain the elegant arguments of Elphick and Wocjan, and also some generalisations to quantum colourings (in part 2).</p>

        <h2 class="card-title">Fixed points of complete positive maps</h2>
        <p>The first of hopefully a few posts about actual Mathematics, the context of which will follow.  In <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~watrous/TQI/">Watrous's QIT book</a>, Theorem 4.25 states the following:</p>
<blockquote class="card-body">
<p>Let \( \Phi:\mathbb M_n\rightarrow\mathbb M_n \) be a unital quantum channel with Kraus representation \( \Phi(x) = \sum_a A_a x A_a^* \).  Then \( \Phi(x)=x \) if and only if \( A_a x = x A_a \) for each \( a \).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Here I translate slightly the language).  Whenever I see a statement about quantum channels, I ask myself if I can translate it into a more Operator Algebraic statement making more use of the Stinespring representation theorem, for example.  After much messing about, I realised that the key property is that \( \Phi \) is <em>trace preserving</em>, and that this, together with <a href="2019-08-04-multdomains.html">multiplicative domain theory</a>, can be used to give a simple proof.  (Well, maybe not <em>simple</em>, but one adding some context.)</p>

        <h2 class="card-title">Mittag-Leffler</h2>
        <p>I spend last week at the <a href="https://www.mittag-leffler.se/">Institute Mittag-Leffler</a> in a suburb of Stockholm, attending the <a href="https://www.mittag-leffler.se/activities/noncommutative-harmonic-analysis-and-quantum-information/">Noncommutative Harmonic Analysis and Quantum Information</a> conference.  The institute is lovely, being comprised of a large, old mansion, various accommodation blocks, a seminar building, all set in lovely grounds.  The weather couldn't have been nicer (well, too hot for me, but I'd probably be happy spending the summer near the arctic circle).  As the <a href="https://www.mittag-leffler.se/about-us/history/">history page</a> explains, the mansion belonged to Mittag-Leffler, and was left in his will to form a Mathematics research institute, but sadly the Great Depression eroded his legacy to the extent that the institute couldn't function as envisaged until the latter part of the 20th century, when additional funding was found.  If you get the chance to visit, I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>The mansion also houses an amazing <a href="https://www.mittag-leffler.se/about-us/library/">Mathematics library</a>.  I took a little photo:</p>

        <p>I got roped into (okay, volunteered for) giving a talk at <a href="https://www.uclan.ac.uk/news/nine-times-a-charm-japan-day-returns-to-uclan">UClan's Japan Day</a> on the theme of Origami.  To quote Tom Lehrer, this I know from nothing.  But one can learn, and I hope I said something interesting in my short talk.</p>

        <h2 class="card-title">Outside the office</h2>
        <p>There has, for more time than I care to think about, been a large, empty display board right outside my office.  My fellow corridor occupants, being (astro)physicists, actually have a culture of making posters, which are then perfect for displaying on said boards.  But what is a Mathematician to do?  I have been planning this for, again, longer than I care to remember, but finally here it is:</p>
<p><img class="fixed-ratio-resize" alt="Photo of the board" src="public/board.jpg"></p>
<p>The evenings spent watching Masterchef and cutting out bits of paper were, well, almost worth it.  It occurs to me that the display of images on this site is not particularly "responsive", but who has the time?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture">Collatz Conjecture</a> is well-known, and fun to play around with (especially into an introduction to programming class).  Some recent progress was <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2019/09/10/almost-all-collatz-orbits-attain-almost-bounded-values/">Tao's work</a> but this all is way outside my zone of expertise.  Still, I think it does make for a nice use of a notice board.</p>

        <h2 class="card-title">Conferencing again, and how to spend time</h2>
        <p>Spending unexpected time in Poznan airport, after a cancelled flight.  I have been at the <a href="https://www.impan.pl/en/activities/banach-center/conferences/22-noncommutative">Noncommutative harmonic analysis and quantum groups</a> conference at Bedlewo palace, postponed at least once due to Covid, most recently from last year.</p>
<p>The conference was good, in the round.  I have gotten out of the habit of travel, at least in part due to Covid, and had initially not planned to attend in person.  I am trying to be more open to new experiences (to say yes to things a bit more, and perhaps say no to some other things).  And, cancelled flight not withstanding, travelling in person was a good thing.  I got to catch up with some people I knew already, and a chance to meet some new people.  The talks were good.  Even the conference outing, kayaking on the river- another chance to say yes to something I would not normally do so- was different, fun, if frustratingly hard to do well.</p>
