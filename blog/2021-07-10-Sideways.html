    <p>Another, more frivolous, listen has been Matthew Syed's excellent Radio 4 series <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000s2kt">Sideways</a>.  In particular, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000t48x">Episode 6</a> made me think of academia.  (But all episodes are well worth a listen, IMHO)</p>
<p>In this episode, "A Recipe for Happiness", in the 2nd half, Syed talks about the experiment at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zappos">Zappos</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holacracy">Holacracy</a>, a rather flat management style (but listen to the episode to really understand what is meant).  </p>
<!--more-->

<p>At about 20:40 is the (short) part which made me think of academia.  Here is Syed discussing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Corporation#Company_structure">Valve</a> which also had a very flat management structure:</p>
<blockquote class="card-body">
<p>In 2013 an ex-employee of Value described a hidden layer of powerful management in the company which made it feel like high-school. ... In flat organisations like these, the lack of formal rules and hierarchy can mask a viscous informal power structure.  But unlike in a good old-fashioned hierarchy there are almost no checks or balances in place.  Powerful Barons can pursue their caprices with few limitations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, this does not describe how, say, a vice-chancellor would think of a university: there are formal rules, for example!  But I think the coal-face of academia does rather well approximate what is being described here-- I do have a lot of freedom in the classroom, and especially around what research I pursue.  But at the same time, there are sort of "hidden rules", around who gets resources, or recognition, or advancement.  Even in popular culture, the idea of tyrannical Professors / Lab Managers abound, and there is a lot more than a kernel of truth to such stereotypes.</p>
<p>As many people in Syed's programme describe, a flat structure can be attractive-- you are your own boss!  But it can also be exhausting, with the constant, subtle, jockeying for recognition (or power, or influence, or whatever you want to call it).  I am not sure I would like to work in a version of academia which had strict hierarchies, or an "internal market".  Especially around research, I see freedom as being incredibly important in fostering creativity; and there is such a vast mismatch between the "5 years is a long time" view of modern business, and the "this is a lifetime's work" which (certainly in mathematics) I see creative thought as being about.  However, I also wonder if a lot of the tension and disappointment in modern academia comes from a failure to understand that academia is a lot closer to a (very imperfect) holocracy than certainly senior managers might think.</p>
