    <p>Posted on 21st September 2022</p>
    <hr>

    <p>Spending unexpected time in Poznan airport, after a cancelled flight.  I have been at the <a href="https://www.impan.pl/en/activities/banach-center/conferences/22-noncommutative">Noncommutative harmonic analysis and quantum groups</a> conference at Bedlewo palace, postponed at least once due to Covid, most recently from last year.</p>
<p>The conference was good, in the round.  I have gotten out of the habit of travel, at least in part due to Covid, and had initially not planned to attend in person.  I am trying to be more open to new experiences (to say yes to things a bit more, and perhaps say no to some other things).  And, cancelled flight not withstanding, travelling in person was a good thing.  I got to catch up with some people I knew already, and a chance to meet some new people.  The talks were good.  Even the conference outing, kayaking on the river- another chance to say yes to something I would not normally do so- was different, fun, if frustratingly hard to do well.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>Having a conference in an isolated venue seemed like a good choice.  You are forced into spending time with people you don't know.  When in a city, oftentimes you spend the whole time with people you already know, which is perhaps not quite the point.  It was also nice to go for walks and a run in the woods, sighting of wild boar aside!</p>
<p>I was the last attendee to leave, and in the downtime, spent some time organising my PDF paper collection.  Over the last few years, perhaps since returning to academia, I have spent a lot of time reading preprints and papers, and have collected a vastly longer "to read" list.  In a similar vein, I referee a lot, perhaps 10-15 times more than I publish.  I have this sense that I need to stop this.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/433471/four-thousand-weeks-by-burkeman-oliver/9781784704001">Oliver Burkleman's 4000 weeks</a> has much to say on this, but it is nicely summed up in his blog post <a href="https://www.oliverburkeman.com/never">What if you never sort your life out?</a>.  I want to read all of the literature to make sure that I understand it all.  To an extent this works- I felt that I followed most of the conference talks, and felt that I understood properly something of many of them.  But what is the end point in all this?  Even if one's goal is simply, only, to understand higher mathematics (and I do not share this goal) there is simply too much: where does one stop?</p>
<p>I am not doing as much of my own research as I would like, and I am not writing as much of that up as I'd like.  I have fallen into this trap of believing that if I just read everything, just finally understood it all, then somehow things would be better.</p>
<p>Of course, knowing everything is both impossible, and wouldn't actually make the agonisingly slow, one step forwards, half a step back, nature of Mathematics research any easier.   Knowing things helps solve problems, but really only knowing the right things.  So I will start doing a bit more, and reading somewhat less.  Those PDFs which I have in my "to read" folder, and yet haven't been read in two years.  I may as well accept that I will never read them (or maybe one day I will have a real reason to read them, in which case, I can read them then)...</p>
