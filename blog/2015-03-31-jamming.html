    <hr>

    <p>I was hoping to take part in <a href="https://code.google.com/codejam">Google Code Jam</a> this year, but for much of Saturday the 11th I'll be transatlantic, flying back from Boston to Leeds, and I'm not sure I fancy my chances so much with jet-lag, no sleep, and much reduced amount of time...</p>
<p>But anyway, I thought it would be fun to look at past problems, and also to try to solve them in C#, as a way of learning more about the language.  I must say that I've found it useful to solve the problems in Python-- it's nice having an iterative environment, and Python is generally fast enough.</p>
<p>So, here are my thoughts on the 2008 Qual round.  See my code on <a href="https://github.com/MatthewDaws/CodeJam/tree/master/2008_qual">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>Save the universe</h2>
<p><a href="https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/32013/dashboard#s=p0">Official problem.</a>  Given S search engine names, and the Q queries: need to assign each query, in the order they arrive, to a search engine different to the query name.  Return the minimal number of times a new search engine is needed.</p>
<p>Example: Names are A, B, C and queries are A B A B B B A then all can be sent to C, so answer is 0  </p>
<p>Example: Names are A, B and queries are A A A B B A.  Then we use the search engines B B B A A B so 2 changes are needed.</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> It feels like a greedy algorithm should work, but does it?  Let's label the search engines 0, 1, 2 and so on.  The problem is to split the input into segments where we can send all the requests to the same search engine: the only constraint is that the used engine must not be in the requests.  Suppose we have segments A0 using engine k0, then A1 using engine k1, and so on.  How can we "improve" this?  Well, we can make A0 bigger (and A1 smaller) so long as the queries in A0 don't use <em>all</em> the search engines (so we still have some choice for k0).  So we may as well assume we've expanded A0 as much as possible: thus A0 either contains all the queries, or it's maximal, so it contains all but one of search engines, and the next query is that unused search engine.</p>
<p>We can then continue this: now choose A1 maximal, and so on.</p>
<p>So the solution is to scan over the input, keeping a list of all the "used" search engines, and once we have used all engines, we start again (with the final query as the new starting query) and increase our "change count".  A little care is required with the case when we've used all the queries.</p>
<p><a href="https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/32013/dashboard#s=a&amp;a=0">The official answer is similar.</a></p>
<h2>Train Timetable</h2>
<p><a href="https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/32013/dashboard#s=p1">Official problem.</a> We have trains timetabled to travel between stations A and B.  Once a train (say) travels from A to B, after a "turnaround" time, it is now free to travel from B to A, and in this way, two or more timetabled journeys may be completed by one train.  Find the minimal numbers of trains needed to start from A and from B to carry out all the timetabled journeys.</p>
<p>Some thought required here.  Form a bipartite graph where there is a vertex for each start time from station A or B (and, if you like, two extra vertices representing "infinity" at A and B).  Consider the vertices in order by time (so the earliest vertices come first).  Then link vertices Ai and Bj, say, if the train starting at Ai will be free to take the journey starting at Bj (that is, taking account of turnaround time, will be train be free?)  Link all the A vertices to B-infinity, and vice versa.  So we end up with a directed graph, and we want to find the minimal number of paths which touch all the vertices.  The example timetable has trains A-&gt;B at times 9-&gt;12, 10-&gt;13, 11-&gt;12:30 and B-&gt;A at times 12:02-&gt;15, 9-&gt;10:30.  As the turnaround time is 5 minutes, the 9-&gt;12 trains is too late to form the 12:02-&gt;15 train.  However, the 9-&gt;10:30 train can form the 11-&gt;12:30 train so we have an edge from B9:00 to A11:00.  We get this graph: <img class="fixed-ratio-resize" alt="Graph" src="./public/1.png"> Here arranged left to right instead of up to down.  Hence the solution is start 2 trains off at A and B.</p>
<p>I don't think any "standard" algorithms can help here.  However, again let us think about a "greedy" solution, and iteratively "improving" (or not making worse) a solution which we have.</p>
<p>Suppose we have some solution, that is, some collection of paths, and let us think of two "moves" which we can perform:
<img class="fixed-ratio-resize" alt="Move A" src="./public/2.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>In both cases, the path from A1 is linked to B2 when it could be linked to B1.  The alternative arrangement shows that we can change the path to link A1 to B1 without changing the fact that some path covers every node.  (In the 2nd case, a train starts at B1 and we move this to a train starting at B2).</li>
<li>So we see that we can make our path link any node in A to the first available node in B, so long as we haven't already "used it" by linking to an earlier node from A.</li>
<li>This means that we can simply work forwards in time with a "greedy" algorithm, linking each node in A or B to the first node available in B or A.</li>
<li>As we only care about the number of trains needed, our algorithm can work as follows:<ul>
<li>Set all nodes to be unvisited.</li>
<li>Take the nodes in time order.</li>
<li>If a node is unvisited, increase the count (for A or B as appropriate).</li>
<li>Link the node to the next available node (according the timetable which specifies the edges of the graph) and make the target node as now being visited.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/32013/dashboard#s=a&amp;a=1">Offical solution</a> uses a Heap instead.  To me, it's not 100% obvious that a greedy strategy is optimal.</p>
<h2>Fly Swatter</h2>
<p><a href="https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/32013/dashboard#s=p2&amp;a=3">Official problem</a> This is long, and geometric, so refer to the Google Code Jam page for details.</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, the fly will hit the racket if and only if the "centre point" of the fly hits an "expanded" racquet (where we increase the size of the strings by exactly the radius of our spherical fly; and similarly increase the racquet ring size). </li>
<li>So reduce the problem to finding the area covered (or the area not covered) by the racquet.</li>
<li>Another simple reduction is to look at one quadrant, because of symmetry.</li>
<li>This reduces to finding the area of squares intersected with a circle (or one quadrant of a circle). </li>
<li>You can figure this out from the formula for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_segment">area of a circular segment</a>.</li>
<li>A little thought shows that there are four generic cases of how a square can intersect, say, the top right quarter of a disc.</li>
<li>So we simply scan over each square, intersect it, and sum the result.  I went to the effort to sort the numbers first, to reduce round-off error.</li>
<li>This is a touch slow for the "large" case, but fast enough.  A trivial speed-up would be to numerically calculate the number of squares which are completely contained in the circle.</li>
</ul>
