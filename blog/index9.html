        <p>Busy at 5pm Saturday when this ran (so all the eggs in the final basket of round 1C).  Under timed conditions, I did problem A very slowly, and B-small in the time, so would have qualified at around place 770.  B-large took a bit longer, and Problem C wasn't really looked at in the time limit.  Hard problems...</p>

<p><strong>Problem A, Counter Culture:</strong> How fast can you get from <code>N</code> from 1 if you are allowed moves of: say one more than the last numbers; or reverse the decimal number.  E.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 21, 22, 23 is the quickest route to 23.</p>

        <p>I've spent some time on <a href="http://codingame.com/">Codingame</a> which is an on-line <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming">Competitive programming</a> site, based around computer games.  (Though only loosely: some puzzles are just puzzles like Google Code Jam, and the "games" are often pretty obviously graph or search based puzzles).  But it's kind of fun: certainly the more interactive puzzles, where your solution has to respond to unknown, almost real-time, inputs, is entertaining.</p>

        <p><img class="fixed-ratio-resize" alt="Profile Picture" src="./public/profile.jpg"></p>
<p>As a change, here is a puzzle I never quite got to the bottom of a few years ago.  Just some flattened disks arranged in a circle and then rendered using LuxRender.  I rather like the effect.  There are two ways to make a cylinder shape: either use the inbuilt primitive objects (so a cylinder with disks top and bottom) or export a cylinder from Blender as a mesh.  Actually, I rolled my own using a python script:</p>

<p>I did this under timed conditions, and would have just qualified.  A silly error was all which stood between B large and me...</p>
<p><strong>Problem A, Osmos:</strong> Start with A and \( (x_i)_{i=1}^N \) integers.  You can absorb one of the \( x_i \) if it's smaller than A, and then A grows by \( x_i \).  Help Armin to be able to absorb all the numbers by adjusting the initial set:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can add any new number;</li>
<li>You can remove a number.</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the least number of moves to get a valid set?</p>

        <p>So, I didn't do this one live, as it ran at 2am UK time...  I did however, for fun, try this under timed conditions a few days later, and I didn't do great, but got enough to qualify (did A and B with 3 silly mistakes from B, then C small, and stupidly didn't think, and tried my slow algorithm on C large.  As large problems are one-shot, it would have been game over, and I'd be around 500 in the ranking.)</p>

<p><strong>Problem A, Mushroom Monster:</strong> Easy, and my solution doesn't differ from the official analysis.</p>

<p>What did you need to do to progress?  Score 30 points in 100 minutes, or more points.  So doing problems A and B would be enough.  Again, tackling the "small" problems quickly is worthwhile.</p>
<p><strong>Problem A, Part Elf:</strong> At generation 40, everyone is 1 or 0 elf.  So at generation 39, everyone is \( \frac12 (a+b) \) elf, where \( 0 \leq a,b \leq 1 \).  By induction, at generation \( 40-n \) everyone is \( a/2^n \) elf, for some integer \( 0 \leq a \leq 2^n \).  So read in <code>P</code> and <code>Q</code>, use Euclid's algorithm to find the gcd and hence write <code>P/Q</code> in lowest terms, and then we need \( P/Q = a / 2^{40} \) so <code>Q</code> should be a power of 2, less than or equal to 40, and we need \( P \leq Q \).</p>

<p>I did this under timed conditions: a mild disaster, but then it was for everyone back in 2013.  If I had been clinical, I could have solved A, B-small and C-small, which would have been enough.</p>
<p><strong>Problem A, Bullseye:</strong> Draw some concentric rings, with a fixed amount of paint.  A bit of maths shows that ring \( n \in \{1,2,3,\cdots\} \) uses \( 2r+4n-3 \) units of paint, so we want the maximal \( N \) with \[ t \geq \sum_{n=1}^N 2r+4n-3 = 2rN + 2N(N+1) - 3N. \]</p>

<p>Of current interest is how to progress: top 1000 people go through, and for that you'd need 42 points in any time faster than basically the whole 2.5 hours.  This seems more reasonable...</p>
<p><strong>Problem A, The Repeater:</strong> Given some input strings and Omar can make a move: he can pick one string, and one character in that string, and either repeat it once more (so "abc" -&gt; "abbc" or "aabc" or "abcc") or if the character is already repeated, he can delete one copy (so "aabcc" -&gt; "abcc" or "aabc").  Can he make all the strings the same, and if so, what's the minimal number of moves to do so?</p>
