        <p>I attended the BMC in Glasgow (sadly remotely: I actually had a hotel booked for the original 2020 date, before Covid19 overwhelmed the UK) and amongst the plenary talks, I perhaps most enjoyed the plenary talk by Kevin Buzzard, which is now <a href="https://media.ed.ac.uk/media/BMC%20BAMC%202021%20Kevin%20Buzzard/1_fu67ebix">available online</a>.  This is a variation on a talk I'd seen before, and Prof Buzzard says a number of things which resonated with me.</p>

<p>This is a follow-on paper from our <a href="2020-02-25-preprint.html">previous work</a>.  We previously look at various notions of "ring-theoretic infiniteness" for Banach algebras, and how these were (or were not) stable under the ultrapower/product constructions.  The one (main) notion we didn't consider was that of being "purely infinite", which is well studied for C*-algebras, and, as it turns out, has also been studied for general (simple) algebras.  We take the definition that a unital (Banach) algebra \( A \) is purely infinite if each non-zero \( a\in A \) there are \( b,c\in A \) with \( bac=1 \).  Again, this property is stable under the ultrapower construction exactly when we have "sufficient norm control": in this case, that we can choose such \( b,c \) with \( \|b\| \|c\| \) uniformly bounded, as \( a \) varies over the unit sphere of \( A \).</p>

        <h2 class="card-title">Counter-examples to Kaplansky Density</h2>
        <p>I've added a short document to my <a href="https://github.com/MatthewDaws/Mathematics/tree/master/Kaplansky2">Mathematical writeups</a> collection.  Thanks to Yemon Choi for a conversation which motivated me to write this up, and to Philip Spain who alerted me to the work of Harry Dowson.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to have a <em>natural</em> Banach Algebra example.  By this, I mean a naturally occurring example of a dual Banach Algebra \( M \) and a weak\( ^\ast \)-dense subalgebra \( A\subseteq M \) such that there is a unit vector in \( M \) which is not the weak\( ^\ast \)-limit of any bounded net in \( A \).</p>
<p>What do I mean by "natural" here?  Some possible examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Let \( E \) be a reflexive Banach space with the approximation property. Then it's known that \( \mathcal B(E) \) is the bidual of \( \mathcal K(E) \).  Thus \( \mathcal K(E) \) is weak\( ^\ast \)-dense in \( \mathcal B(E) \), but in this case, we do have an (isometric) version of Kaplansky Density, because biduals satisfy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldstine_theorem">Goldstine's Theorem</a>.  I still think this example is a little interesting: if \( E \) had the metric approximation property, given \( T\in\mathcal B(E) \) it is easy to write down a net in \( \mathcal K(E) \) which converges to \( T \) and is bounded by \( \|T\| \).  If \( E \) merely has the approximation property then this seems less clear to me, though it is ensured by the general theory.  <strong>Update:</strong> This was a little naive: if \( E \) is <em>reflexive</em> then it goes back to Grothendieck that \( E \) having the AP already implies that \( E \) has the MAP.  So really there is no mystery here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let \( G \) be a locally compact group, and consider \( PM_p(G) \) which by definition is the weak\( ^\ast \) closure of \( PF_P(G) \) inside \( \mathcal B(L^p(G)) \).  Excepting when \( p=2 \) I do not know if we have Kaplansky Density here, though if \( G \) has a suitable approximation-like property (amenability, or a weakening) then I believe one can show this: I don't know if this is explicitly in the literature.</p>

        <p>Another release of <a href="https://github.com/MatthewDaws/TileMapBase">TileMapBase</a> which fix some warnings which had started to be been displayed, because of changing APIs in some libraries which we use.  I also had some minor corrections to docstrings.  Released on PyPI.</p>
<p>A quick further retrospective.  Do I enjoy writing code?  Yes, still.  Do I enjoying fighting with the tools to get things to work?  No, not in the slightest.  Below are some notes to self for how I got various libraries installed.</p>

        <p>For various reasons relating to <a href="making LaTeX accessible">https://github.com/MatthewDaws/AccessibleLaTeX</a> I have ended up down a rabbit-hole of trying to understand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open Source Software</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-software_license">Licenses</a>, and related ideas, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons">Creative Commons</a>.

        <p>Cleaning out my desk, I came across some plans for further work on <a href="https://matthewdaws.github.io/comp.html#ds">predictive policing</a>.  It now seems rather unlikely I will have time to pursue these (what with a fixed number of hours in a day, and a desire to be a research in Mathematics, at least at the moment).  I thought I might as well record the ideas here.</p>

        <p>A couple of new <a href="https://github.com/MatthewDaws/Mathematics">research notes</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some notes on <a href="https://github.com/MatthewDaws/Mathematics/tree/master/Inductive-Limits">inductive limits</a> of Banach spaces and algebras.  I don't have a use for this rather esoteric topic, but a couple of textbooks make (slightly) wrong claims, so I wrote up some notes and carefully checked how far we could get things to work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A quick proof showing how to get the <a href="https://github.com/MatthewDaws/Mathematics/tree/master/Kaplansky">Kaplansky Density Theorem</a> by using Arens products, and "elementary" (for various values of elementary) \( C^* \)-algebra theory.</p>
