Java Developer in Leeds.

Until mid-2015 I was an academia Mathematician, and using the [Mathematical Work](mathematics/index.html) link below you can see some things of interest, Mathematically speaking.

* Some stuff on [GitHub](https://github.com/MatthewDaws).
* Email: matthew.daws@gmail.com

## Past-times

   - ![Project Euler profile](http://projecteuler.net/profile/MattDaws.png) [Project Euler site](https://projecteuler.net/)  A lot of fun for a Mathematician interested in programming.  But a time sink...

   - Codingame "Guru" (not that this is hard...) [Link to tediously large profile](http://www.codingame.com/profile/bd0243829ec40704b09a8ae29cf99c4c744628)
   
   - Some [Google Code Jam solutions](https://github.com/MatthewDaws/CodeJam) on GitHub; I was too slow in 2015!

## Template

These GitHub hosted pages are:

* Using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Based on the [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) template
