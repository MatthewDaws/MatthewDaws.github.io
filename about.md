Previously:

- Python developer, part-time statistician, research fellow at [School of Geography, University of Leeds](http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk).  See [QuantCrim on GitHub](https://github.com/QuantCrimAtLeeds), and [SEPP](https://github.com/MatthewDaws/SEPP/).
- Java developer (Spring, Maven, Jenkins, TDD, Tomcat, MongoDB, web-scraping, etc.) at [QuantBet LLP, Leeds](http://www.quantbet.com).
- Lecturer in Mathematics at the [University of Leeds](www.maths.leeds.ac.uk).

### Computational past-times

   - ![Project Euler profile](http://projecteuler.net/profile/MattDaws.png) [Project Euler site](https://projecteuler.net/)  A lot of fun for a Mathematician interested in programming.  But a time sink...

   - Some [Google Code Jam solutions](https://github.com/MatthewDaws/CodeJam) on GitHub; I was too slow in 2015; and didn't compete beyond the prelim round in 2017.
