Python developer, part-time statistician, research fellow at [School of Geography, University of Leeds](http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk).  The current project involves GIS, crime detection algorithms, open source development.  See [QuantCrim on GitHub](https://github.com/QuantCrimAtLeeds).

Previously, I worked as a Java developer (Spring, Maven, Jenkins, TDD, Tomcat, MongoDB, web-scraping, etc.) at [QuantBet LLP, Leeds](http://www.quantbet.com).  Before this, I was academia Mathematician, and using the [Mathematical Work](mathematics/index.html) link below you can see some things of interest, Mathematically speaking.

## Computational past-times

   - ![Project Euler profile](http://projecteuler.net/profile/MattDaws.png) [Project Euler site](https://projecteuler.net/)  A lot of fun for a Mathematician interested in programming.  But a time sink...

   - Some [Google Code Jam solutions](https://github.com/MatthewDaws/CodeJam) on GitHub; I was too slow in 2015; and didn't compete beyond the prelim round in 2017.
