# Learning Python UI programming

Another new task: get going with some GUI programming!

### Some references

- [Tkinter 8.5 reference: a GUI for Python](http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/pubs/tkinter/web/index.html) - Lots and lots.  On the web, or a 168 page PDF file.
- [TkDocs](http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/index.html) - Cross platform, but does mention Python.
- [Official docs](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/tk.html)


### Some books

As culled from Leeds University Library:

- [User interface design : a software engineering perspective](http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2465501~S5)  2005.  Sounds interesting though.
- [Designing the user interface : strategies for effective human-computer interaction](http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b3181441~S5)  2010.  Seems like a bit more of a textbook.
- [http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2024752~S5(http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2024752~S5)  2000.  Picked out after looking at books on the shelf.
