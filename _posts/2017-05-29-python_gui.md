title: Learning Python UI programming

Another new task: get going with some GUI programming!

### Some references

- [Tkinter 8.5 reference: a GUI for Python](http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/pubs/tkinter/web/index.html) - Lots and lots.  On the web, or a 168 page PDF file.
- [TkDocs](http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/index.html) - Cross platform, but lots of Python examples.  I found this pretty good!
- [Official docs](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/tk.html)
- [Effbot Book](http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/) - A "work in progress" and old, but still, so I've found, is an excellent reference and guide.


### Hints and tip

- [Tooltips in tkinter](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3221956)
- [Basic quick start guide](http://usingpython.com/simple-gui-programming/) - Rather basic, but a nice intro.
- [Brief intro](http://www.devdungeon.com/content/gui-programming-python) - Nice one-page introduction (with lots of images; handy when discussing GUIs!)
- [OOP in Python chapter](http://python-textbok.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/Introduction_to_GUI_Programming.html) - More of an introduction than anything else.
- [Threads and Tkinter](http://stupidpythonideas.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/why-your-gui-app-freezes.html) - How to send data back to the GUI thread.
- [Modal dialogs in Tkinter](http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/tkinter-dialog-windows.htm) - The method `.wait_window()` is necessary but not sufficient.


### Some books

As culled from Leeds University Library:

- [User interface design : a software engineering perspective](http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2465501~S5)  2005.  Sounds interesting though.
- [Designing the user interface : strategies for effective human-computer interaction](http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b3181441~S5)  2010.  Seems like a bit more of a textbook.
- [Usability engineering](http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2024752~S5)  2000.  Picked out after looking at books on the shelf.
