title: PyPi and use of ReStructuredText
---

I've in the process of putting together my first proper Python package to be uploaded to [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) / [PyPi Old](https://pypi.python.org/pypi).
The docs around doing this are not great, but the official docs are pretty good:

- [Old docs; still a good read](https://docs.python.org/3.6/distutils/index.html)
- [Setuptools](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Guide to `setup.py`](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html)
- [Packaging guide](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/)
- [Using TestPyPi](https://packaging.python.org/guides/using-testpypi/)

One thing which was unclear to me was how to specify the text which gets displayed on PyPi.  After some playing, it seems that:

1. This should be set in the `long_description` variable of `setup()` or in `setup.cfg`
2. This needs to be ReStructuredText not Markdown, for example.

Some searching found a solution:

- Download [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
- Download [Pypandoc](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypandoc) : `pip install pypandoc`
- (Or use Conda for both steps in one)
- Then you can dynamically generate a `rst` file when `setup.py` is invoked:

        try:
            import pandoc
            doc = pandoc.Document()
            with open('readme.md', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                doc.markdown = f.read().encode("utf-8")
            with open("README.rst", "wb") as f:
                f.write(doc.rst)
        except:
            print("NOT REFRESHING README.rst")

        with open('README.rst', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            long_description = f.read()

- Enclosing in `try/except` means I haven't broken `setup` for users without `pypandoc`
