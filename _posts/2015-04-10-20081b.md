title: Jam 2008 Round 1B
---

I found this to be somewhat harder than round A.  Also, my solutions in Python, running on my 2013 era laptop, are rather slow, so really a C++ or similar implementation would be needed, especially on 2008 era hardware.

Again, The [Official Contest Analysis](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/32017/dashboard#s=a) is a good writeup, so I won't say a great deal.  See the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/MatthewDaws/CodeJam/tree/master/2008_1b).

**Problem A:** Once you realise the trick, this is a simple combinatorial problem!  (And solvable easily in Python).

**Problem B:** In the end, I went with a "disjoint union" data structure, as in the official writeup.  My implementation in Python uses a dictionary, and is hence a bit more general than necessary (and so probably slower).  Also need a prime sieve to find the primes efficiently.  I did experiment with forming a graph and finding components, but this seemed very slow.

**Problem C:** I will admit to looking at the official solutions for a hint for the "large" case.  My version uses the clever, third, idea.  Again, slow in Python.
