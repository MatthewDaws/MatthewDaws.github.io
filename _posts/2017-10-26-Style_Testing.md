I've written some stuff for the University of Leeds Python Discussion Group on
[Code style, tooling, testing, all that Jazz](https://github.com/UoLPythonGroup/training/tree/master/style).

I'll try and do some live coding, and get some debate going tomorrow.  But the above can be read as a bit of blog post as well.
