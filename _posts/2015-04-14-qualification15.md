title: Code Jam Qualification 2015
---

As expected, flight back from Boston to Leeds via Dublin resulted in zero sleep, and so hopes were not overly high for the [2015 Qualification Round](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/6224486/dashboard).  But, only 20 points needed to progress, which can't be too hard, right?

Anyway, in the end, I got 100%, and seem to be the highest ranked UK participant.  This, one suspects, won't last...!

Some code on [GitHub](https://github.com/MatthewDaws/CodeJam/tree/master/2015_qual).  On the todo list is to update this post with some comments, but my solutions are pretty similar to the [Offical Analysis](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/6224486/dashboard#s=a).
