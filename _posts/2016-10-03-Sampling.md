title: Random sampling to see a percentage of a population.
---

   > Given a population $$P$$ and sampling at random ("with replacement") what's the expected number of samples I need to see 50% (or any fixed proportion) of the population.
   
I deliberately ask for "expected" because calculating expectations is often easier thn getting a handle on the whole probability distribution.  A trick is to exploit linearity: express the random variable of interest as a sum of random variables you can calculate the expectation of.

Sampling at random from $$P$$, suppose we have seen exactly $$k$$ members of $$P$$.  As each sample is independent, letting $$T_k$$ denote the number of samples required to see a new member of $$P$$, we see that
\\[ \mathbb P(T_k = j) = \left(\frac{k}{\vert P\vert}\right)^{j-1} \frac{\vert P\vert-k}{\vert P\vert} \\]
That is, a [geometric distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution), and so $$\mathbb E(T_k) = \frac{\vert P\vert}{\vert P\vert-k}$$.  By convention, $$T_0=1$$.

Then, if I want to see exactly $$n$$ members, the time needed is $$S_n = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} T_j$$.  We can estimate the expectation by an integral,
\\[ \mathbb E(S_n) \approx \vert P\vert \int_{\vert P\vert-n}^{\vert P\vert+1} \frac 1 x \ dx
= \vert P\vert \log \Big( \frac{\vert P\vert+1}{\vert P\vert-n} \Big) \\]

Hence, in answer to our original question, we need on average $$0.7 \vert P\vert$$ samples to see half of $$P$$.
