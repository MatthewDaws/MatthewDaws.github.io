title: PyMC3

I'm finally doing some work which requires some genuine Bayesian analysis, and so have returned to playing with `emcee`.  I've also been looking at `PyMC3` which is an impressive piece of work, but also requires a bit of change of thinking from `emcee`.

Some [notebooks can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/MatthewDaws/Python_bits/tree/master/pymc_etc).
