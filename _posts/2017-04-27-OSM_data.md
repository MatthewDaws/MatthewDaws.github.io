title: Open Street Map Data
---

I'm currently working on using some address information from open street map to augment other open data sources.  Here are some notes on using data from open street map, in Python.

## Getting and using Open StreetMap Data

It seems like this is a bit of a pain.  Open StreetMap (OSM) uses a custom, XML based, format which is hard/impossible for standard GIS software to read.

## Data sources

- http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm Gives links to download the world and various extracts of it.
- http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API Details the "Overpass API" which allows targeted querying of data from the OSM database.  (The `OSMnx` package seems great for making direct, small-scale queries.)


## GeoFabrik

http://download.geofabrik.de/  Offer downloads of regions of the world, either in OSM format, or converted to shape-file format.  The latter can be loaded into geopandas, QGIS etc. etc. but appears, sadly, to be missing useful information.  For example, I can [locate a building](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/210164834) and find the polygon for this (by it's ID) in the shapefile, but there is no meta-data attached to give me e.g. the address!

However, for off the shelf analysis using existing tools, this is perhaps where to start.


## Format

The standard format is XML, either compressed, or packaged using [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/).

- http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_XML Gives the XML format
- http://overpass-api.de/output_formats.html Gives details of the JSON format which the Overpass API can return.
- http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features Gives details of the "features" the returned data can contain.


## Libraries

I should probably be using [pyOsmium](http://osmcode.org/pyosmium/) but there is no conda build, and being stuck with either a windows box, or a locked-down linux box, I am scared to try to get it to build.

**GDAL / OGR** can be easily installed (or come for free with geopandas).

- http://www.gdal.org/drv_osm.html Gives some brief details
- [A cookbook](https://pcjericks.github.io/py-gdalogr-cookbook/vector_layers.html) for GDAL.
- I didn't have a great deal of luck finding the details I wanted.


### OSMnx

It seems that others have had similar thoughts to me.  [OSMnx](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx) looks to be a great tool for network analysis of road networks.  The [review paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309738462_OSMnx_New_Methods_for_Acquiring_Constructing_Analyzing_and_Visualizing_Complex_Street_Networks) is also very informative, with some nice background information.

With Anaconda, it's a one-line install:

    conda install -c conda-forge osmnx

This seems very nice for targeted downloads, but it's a bit too "magic" for my tastes.  The source code is very readable however, and I've been learning a lot from it.
