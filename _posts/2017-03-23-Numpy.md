title: Working with numpy again
---

In my new job, I find myself working with numpy (after a break of a couple of years, and now professionally, and
not as a hobby.)  Numpy is great, but it doesn't half require a little thinking upon occasion.

> Suppose we have an array of 10 points in the plane.  Should this be represented as a `numpy` array of shape `(2,10)` or `(10,2)`?

### Argument from kernels

Suppose I want to write a function which represents a two dimensional kernel, for example:

    def ker(x,y):
       return x + 2 * y
       
This doesn't vectorise at all: I cannot do

    p = np.array([1,2])
    ker(p)
    
So instead we might write:

    def ker(p):
       return p[0] + 2 * p[1]
       
Then, to vectorise across my array of 10 points, evaluated the kernel at each point, I need my array to have shape `(2,10)`.

This is exactly the convention chosen by the `kernel` object which [Scipy stats Gaussian KDE](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.gaussian_kde.html) will produce, for example.

### Argument from broadcasting

Given my 10 points, I should be able to translate them all by the same amount, by just adding a point.

    my_array + point
    
For this to work, I need to work with the [Numpy broadcasting rules](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.broadcasting.html) which imply shape `(10,2)`:

    my_array = np.random.random(20).reshape((10,2))
    point = np.array([2,3])
    my_array + point

So if you're working with things your thinking of as spatial "vectors", the other convention seems most natural.  This is exactly the convention chosen by e.g. [Scipy Spatial KDTree](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.KDTree.html#scipy.spatial.KDTree).

### What to do?

I guess you pick a convention, stick with it, and translate (e.g. using `.T`) as necessary.

A further hint is to [read the broadcasting rules very closely](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/ufuncs.html#broadcasting) and to know that indexing with `None` is the same as adding a new axis:

    my_array = np.random.random(20).reshape((10,2))
    new_array = my_array[:,None,:]
    print(new_array.shape) # (10,1,2)
